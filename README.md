# SYCL SHA-512 hashing

## Background

This project was originally a part of a university assessment for the CS4097 
Security course at the University of Aberdeen. The goal of that assessment
was accelerating dictionary cracking of password hashes created using the
SHA-512 hashing algorithm.

## Building

### Dependencies

- [Intel® oneAPI compiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html)*
- (optional) [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)

\* To run on Nvidia or AMD GPUS
[an open source plugin](https://codeplay.com/solutions/oneapi/plugins/) 
by Codeplay® is needed

### Generating Build files

The project uses CMake for build file generation as such the files can be 
generated by running:
`cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<Compiler> -D <Vendor name>_GPU=ON`

Where:
- `<Compiler>` is a valid Intel SYCL compiler (`clang` or `icpx`)
- `<Vendor name>` is a valid GPU vendor (`NVIDIA`, `AMD` or `INTEL`)(not 
  mutually exclusive)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the chosen vendors include NVIDIA and/or AMD the target architectures can 
> be specified via `-D NVIDIA_ARCH=<Architecture>` and/or 
> `-D AMD_ARCH=<Architecture>`

> [!CAUTION]
> Due to personal access to hardware only the NVIDIA sm_86 option has been 
> tested

For troubleshooting/compatibility 2 more CMake options are available 
`CHECK_CORRECTNESS` and `USE_GPU`. Both of them are booleans set to true by 
default. Toggling the first one disables OpenSSL dependency. Toggling the 
second one disables GPU acceleration and forces a CPU fallback. 

### Building and Running
